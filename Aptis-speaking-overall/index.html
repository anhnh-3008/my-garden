This picture depicts the scenery on the bus. I see a girl, she is wearing a casual clothes. I guess she is about 19-20 years old. She is holding the bus handle and looking outside. Maybe she is preparing to get off the bus. Surrounding the girl, there are ma ny people sitting on the bus.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>What are the advantages of public vehicle?</strong>
I think there are many advantages of public vehicle. Firstly, I can save my money instead of using my individual vehicle. Furthermore, I can do some other activities such as read a book, finish my job and so on. Specialy, It is obvious that public vehicle will protect the enviroment. Where I am living, the assmotphere is very pollution.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>The main cause of traffic jam is that people prefer to use their own vehicles instead of public ones. How to encourage people to use public transport?</strong>
There are many ways to encourage people to use public transport. Firstly, I think people are more likely to use public transportation if it is convienient and easily accessible. Increasing numbers of stops, vehicles is a good way. Furthermore, raising awareness about the enviroment, health and economic benefits of using public transportation can encourage more people to use it.</p></li></ol><a href=#-part3-compare-these-two-pictures><h2 id=-part3-compare-these-two-pictures><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part3: Compare these two pictures</h2></a><p><img src="/00 Meta/01 Attachments/Pasted image 20230213144547.png" width=auto class=myImg></p><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Compare two pictures</strong>
Both two pictures depict the scenery of activities for the kids.
Regarding the first picture, I see there are many students with their supervisor. They are visiting a museum. I guess they are in a Museum of Nature because there are some fossils in front of their faces.
Remaning picture, there is a baby girl in casual clothes at the playground. She is running through a small bridge. Smile is written on her face, obviously she is enjoing this activity.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Which activites should children join?</strong>
I reckon that we shouldn&rsquo;t spend too much time on either activities. Instead, they need to balance it. In my opinion, children should spend more time on educational activities than entertainment activities. Because knowledge and mindset are very important for their future. When they are young, studying new something will easier and more effective.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Why learning through games is considered the most effective way?</strong>
I think that there are 2 reasons explaning this opinion.
Firstly, when learning via games, children will feel more interesting and comfortable than traditional way. Therefore, it will help them easier to gain knowledge.
Remaining reason, nowaday, there are many various games that serve education. Children can comfortable choose games to learn new something.</p></li></ol><a href=#-part4-discuss-about-topic><h2 id=-part4-discuss-about-topic><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part4: Discuss about topic</h2></a><ol><li>🌱 If my memory serves right, the last time I used the internet was many years ago. I remember, at that time, I didn&rsquo;t have a personal computer, I used only it at primary school. It was not connected to the internet. Until my 14 birthday, my mom bought a computer for me, at that time I had experience with the internet. I spent many time on play online games with my friends.</li><li>🌱 At first, I felt so amazing when I can talk to many people in the world. Besides, I can find everything I want in the internet, such as courses, books, famous songs and so on. The internet helped my life is easier and more convenient.</li><li>🌱 In my opinion, we should decide how much time we want to use the internet and stick to it. You can also set specific times for checking emails, working, social media and other activities. Furthermore, the internet has wealth of information, so we should use it to improve yourself such as learn new skills, discover new ideas and so on. Besides, we should allocate our entertainment activities outside after time to use the internet.</li></ol><a href=#-exam-2-when-you-read-a-good-book><h1 id=-exam-2-when-you-read-a-good-book><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌳 Exam 2: When you read a good book</h1></a><a href=#-part2-describe-the-picture-1><h2 id=-part2-describe-the-picture-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part2: Describe the picture</h2></a><p><img src="/00 Meta/01 Attachments/Pasted image 20230212174113.png" width=auto class=myImg></p><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Describe this picture</strong>
This picture depicts the scenery of a family. I see there are 4 people in a car. They are wearing casual clothes. The man in a red shirt is riding the car and the woman next to him is talking to her daughter. Smiles are written on their faces so I think They are having an interesting activity together, such as camping or back to their hometown.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Tell me the last time you learned to drive a car</strong>
If my memory serves me right, the last time I learned to drive a car was 2 years ago. I remember that is is so difficult for me. It took me 3 months to complete that couse. But that is also an interesting experience in my life.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Do you think it’s necessary to learn to drive a car?</strong>
Yes, I think learning to drive a car is necessary because it provides more convenience and easier to move to far places, especially when you started a family. If you living in my country, is Vietnam, you should to learn as soon as possible because it is getting harder to harder.</p></li></ol><a href=#-part3-compare-these-two-pictures-1><h2 id=-part3-compare-these-two-pictures-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part3: Compare these two pictures</h2></a><p><img src="/00 Meta/01 Attachments/Pasted image 20230213184424.png" width=auto class=myImg></p><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Compare two pictures</strong>
These pictures depict two difference ways to listen to music.
Regarding the first picture, It shows the scenery in a live consert. I see a man is playing an electric guitar. I guess he is the main vocal of his band because there is a microphone in front of him. Judging through his clothes and the background, maybe this is a rock concert.
Remainning picture, there is a man in casual clothes. He is sitting on the couch and listening to music in his headphone. I feel he is very comfortable, maybe he is listening to his favorite song.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Which way of experiencing music do you prefer?</strong>
Because as an introvert, I prefer to listen to music in a quiet place. It&rsquo;s not like to listen to in concert, I can choose every song I like. Besides, currently the songs have a very good quality sound. I can deep into the music whenever I want.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>What are the benefits of listening to music?</strong>
In my opinion, I think there are two important benefits of listening to music. Firstly, listen to music help to adjust our emotion. We can reduce stress or improve mood with a favorite song. Overmore, this activity can improve our sleep. This is very important for our lifes.</p></li></ol><a href=#-part4-discuss-about-topic-1><h2 id=-part4-discuss-about-topic-1><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part4: Discuss about topic</h2></a><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Describe a book that you enjoy reading</strong>
I just finished reading a non-fiction book last week. The book was usually called &lsquo;Sapiens&rsquo; by author Yuval Noah Harari. The book introduces me to three big revolutions of humans. Besides, It tells me how to operate the gene from that exploring many interesting effect of psychology</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>How do you feel when you read an entertaining book?</strong>
I feel relax and interesting when read an entertaining book. It&rsquo;s like watching a movie but I can imagine whaterver I want. Swapping between fiction and non-fiction book help me to not feel bored. It is a good way to keep my reading habit.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>What do you think is the reason people prefer to watch movies or read books nowadays?</strong>
Obviously, watching movies is more interesting than reading books. A film&rsquo;s combination between music and beautiful actors or actrees helps us to more enjoy it. Another reason, maybe people don&rsquo;t want to imagine when reading books. But I advise you should more read books because this thing can help you improve your imagination and reading skill.</p></li></ol><a href=#-exam-3-thể-thao-mạo-hiểm><h1 id=-exam-3-thể-thao-mạo-hiểm><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌳 Exam 3: Thể thao mạo hiểm</h1></a><a href=#-part2-describe-the-picture-2><h2 id=-part2-describe-the-picture-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part2: Describe the picture</h2></a><p><img src="/00 Meta/01 Attachments/Pasted image 20230212210631.png" width=auto class=myImg></p><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Describ the picture</strong>
This picture depicts the scenery in the supermarket. I see a beautiful girl with a yellow hair. She is wearing casual clothes so judging through it, I guess she is about 24-25 years old. She is pushing her trolley with many items. Maybe she is preparing for her dinner. A smile is written on her face, obviously, she is enjoying this activity. Surrounding the girl, there are so many items on the shelves. This photo is beautiful, I think it might be taken by a professional.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>When was the last time you went to a supermarket?</strong>
If my memory serves me right, the last time I went to a supermarket was probably a week ago. That day, my best friend had a birthday party so we went to a nearly supermarket to got some items for this party. Everything are also interesting for us so we bought many goods. Obviously, the bill hurt our hearts.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Why do many people prefer to go to the supermarket instead of going to the street market?</strong>
I reckon that it totally depends on what they need to purchase. But regarding the above opinion I think because the supermarket has more many items than the street market. The consumers can easier to choose variety of goods. Besides, items in the supermarket have verified quality it help to the consumers are more peace of mind.</p></li></ol><a href=#-part3-compare-these-two-pictures-2><h2 id=-part3-compare-these-two-pictures-2><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>🌿 Part3: Compare these two pictures</h2></a><p><img src="/00 Meta/01 Attachments/Pasted image 20230213225054.png" width=auto class=myImg></p><ol><li><p>🌱 <strong>Compare two pictures</strong>
These pictures depict two kinds of food.
The first picture shows us a men is smiling with healthy foods on his hands. There are many vegestables and fruits in front of him. I guess purpose of this picture is encourage people more eat healthy foods.
Remaining picture, I see there are 4 people in casual clothes. They are eating a pizza together.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Do you prefer junk food or healthy food?</strong>
I don&rsquo;t have any strict things about the kinds of food. Following my emotion, when I stress about something, I want to eat some junk foods. It help me to comfortable. In contrast, when I have a good emotion, I need healthy food to control my weight as well as have a healthy lifestyle.</p></li><li><p>🌱 <strong>Healthy food is trendy because it helps people become strong and save money. Do you agree with this point of view?</strong>
I don&rsquo;t totally agree about this opinion. Firstly, the healthy food helps us to have a strong body. It&rsquo;s right. You can control your weight with the kind. But saving money, I don&rsquo;t think so. As I know, the main source of the healthy food is organic food so it is not cheap at all.
