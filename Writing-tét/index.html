Dear Chau,
How is it going?
Have you received the latest email from the Museum club about collecting entrance tickets?
I don&rsquo;t think this is a good solution. I suppose that implementing a member system to encourage visitors to come back, also we still have more expense for the repair and maintenance of the museum. What do you think?
Drop me a line.

Dear Manager,
My name is Hoang Anh and I have been a member of the Museum club for three months.
I am writing this email to give my suggestion regarding the issue of our club.
Firstly. I reckon that collecting entrance tickets might discourage visitors from visiting the museum. Therefore, my suggestion is we would consider implementing a member system or a yearly pass program. This way provides a steady stream of income for the repair and maintenance of the museum while also might encourage visitors to visit again. Furthermore, offering multiple member options might approach a wider audience.
Thank you for your considering my suggestion. I am looking forward to receiving your response as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully,

Firstly, I feel so excited when receiving an announcement about organizing some face-to-face meetings for the club members next month.
Regarding my suggestion, I know a park near my university is very suitable for the requirements of the club. This place has a large and safe playground. We can organize some outdoor activities for children. Next to the playground has a cafeteria, we can organize some indoor activities for adults such as presentations. Therefore, adults still have a quiet place to communicate with each other, and also might watch their children in the playground.

Regarding my suggestion, I reckon that it would be great if the film critic could speak on the topic &ldquo;The Evolution of Film: From Silent Movies to Modern Blockbusters&rdquo;. It will be interesting for both young and old people because it covers the history of cinema and its evolution over the years. Furthermore, this topic could touch on various aspects of filmmaking such as technology, storytelling, acting, and so on. It helps us to understand How to make a movie.

Dear Manager,
My name is Hoang Anh and I have been a member of the Travel Club for three months.
I am writing this email to give my suggestion after receiving the issue about our members running into language barriers when traveling to different parts of the world.
Regarding my suggestion, it would be better if the club could consider organizing some classes which teach our members some key phrases namely greetings, basic necessities or common expressions in the most common local languages. Besides, we could sum them up in a database and share it with all the members.
I believe this solution could make people overcome language barriers when traveling abroad.

Dear Manager,
My name is Hoang Anh and I have been a member of the Sports club for three months.
I am writing this email to give my suggestion regarding the announcement of our club.
According to the announcement, our club will launch a campaign in order to make youngsters more active and energetic.
Regarding my suggestion, I reckon that social media could be a helpful tool to engage young people. We could create a hashtag for our campaign and encourage people to share their fitness journey and process online. Overmore, we could consider organizing a fitness challenge with prizes given to those who achive specific milestones.
I hope my suggestion could be helpful for the club.
Thank you for your considering my suggestion. I am looking forward to receiving your response as soon as possible.
Yours faithfully,
Hoang Anh</p></li></ol><a href=#part2-8><h4 id=part2-8><span class=hanchor arialabel=Anchor># </span>Part2</h4></a><p>Last weekend, I played football with my group of friends.
